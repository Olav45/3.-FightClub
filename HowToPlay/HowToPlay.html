                            Player 1 moves left and right by pressing the <b>[A]</b> and <b>[D]</b> keys where <b>[A]</b> moves you left and <b>[D]</b> moves you right. Player 2 moves using the <b>[ArrowRight]</b> and <b>[ArrowLeft]</b> keys on the keyboard. Note that different characters have different movement speeds meaning some characters will move faster than others.

You can control the height of your jump by how long you press down the jump key. All characters have a max jumpheight where you will start falling back down. All characters have a double jump meaning that if your jump has stopped you can jump again without having landed on the ground first. If you have jumped twice you will have to land on the ground before jumping again. Note that all characters have different jumpheights and gravity meaning some characters can stay i the air for a lot longer than others.

Note that different players will have different melee attacks that will deal different damage.

                            Player 1 performs a projectile attack by pressing <b>[R]</b> and Player 2 does the same by pressing <b>[-]</b>. Projectile attacks are long ranged attacks that deal damage on impact. They are easier to hit than melee attacks but deal less damage. Note that different players have different projectile attacks that deal differentiating damage and move at different speeds. Some projectile attacks have gravity applied.

                            Player 1 performs a ultimate attack by pressing <b>[F]</b> and Player 2 does the same by pressing <b>[.]</b>. Ultimate attacks need to be charged up before use. Ultimate attacks get charged up by succesfully landing either melee or projectile attacks on your opponent. Once charged up you will be able to perform an ultimate attack. Note that different players have different ultimate attacks that deal different damage and that behave differently. Some characters ultimate attacks are melee whilst others are projectile attacks.
